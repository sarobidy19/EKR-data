## Description

This web page is meant to be a ``comprehensive'' database on the intersection densities of transitive groups of small degree. In each file, you will find the intersection densities of transitive groups of degree \(n \leq 21\). The data in each file is presented as a table where 
* \( n \): is the degree of the transitive group
* \( k \): is the number in the library of transitive groups in ``Sagemath``
* *Description*: the structure description of the group
* *Density*: the intersection density of \( \operatorname{TransitiveGroup}(n,k) \)
* *Information*: this entry either is either **Abelian** (in which case the intersection density is \( 1 \) and the group is regular) or a link to a file containing further information on the derangement graph of \( \operatorname{TransitiveGroup}(n,k) \).
